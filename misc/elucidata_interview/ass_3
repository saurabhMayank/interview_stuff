You are given with a txt file. This file captures the output of a mass spec machine after an experiment run. In a typical experiment, multiple solutions are inserted (sequentially) into a mass spec machine. Each solution contains a bunch of chemicals compounds. The machine captures signal of each compound in each solution. 

There are 5 columns in this file, each explained below:
1. Metabolite Name: This column contains the name of the metabolite.
2. Fragment Name: During the experiment each metabolite is broken into fragments, so for the same metabolite there can be multiple fragments.
3. Sample: While doing the experiment, samples are passed through the machines. Each sample contains several metabolites, all of which are separated by the mass spec machine and their intensity measured.
4. Intensity: Intensity is the measured value. A value of intensity can be uniquely identified by Fragment Name and Sample combined i.e. if given a sample 119 and fragment Citrate 191/111, we will one and only one intensity value.
5 Cohort: This column contains some properties which are common to different samples. For example Cohort with value "A. G9 13C-Gln 0min" can have list of samples associated with it [S119, S135, S151, S167, S183, S199] which are technical replicates. 

You have to write a flask/Django server where a user uploads this file. After uploading the file do the following processing on the file.
Filter the data for values of Cohort containing the word "std". On the filtered data, add intensities for all fragments corresponding to one metabolite. This is done for each sample.

So the output format should be something like this:
Sample Cohort Metabolite Intensity
S1     CohA   A          3290
S2     CohA   A          4398 
S3     CohB   A          5232
S4     CohB   A          8020
Return this table for all metabolites.

**(Bonus Analysis)**
Convert the format of the table such that 
Cohort   Intensity1  I2
CohA   3290 4398
CohB   5232 8020

The above are just sample formats, values and names will be different for given files. Use pandas for the processing and minimal for loop.
The analyzed file should be downloaded as a response to the upload API. 

You can use a very minimalistic frontend for this problem.
